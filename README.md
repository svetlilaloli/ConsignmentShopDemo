# ConsignmentShopDemo
Using Windows Forms, create an application that can be used by consignment shops to run their business. You need to know who the individuals/ vendors are who have items in the shop and you need to associate these vendors with their items. Each vendor should be assigned a standard commission, but that may need to be changed on a per-vendor basis. The application should track how much should be paid to each vendor as well as how much money should be paid to the store.

## Requirements
1. List of vendors
2. List of items per vendor
3. Each vendor should have a default commission rate
4. Commissions can change
5. Track how much to pay the vendor
6. Track how much to pay the store
